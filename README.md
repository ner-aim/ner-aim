## GUTEN TAG! 👋
### I am Pradyumn K. Pottapatri! You can call me Sid!

## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** building scalable ML systems, supporting supply chain strategy, time-series pipelines for anomaly detection, applied AI solutions for driving multimillion dollar impact.  

- 🧩 Currently exploring **Computer Vision, Gen AI**, developing a **custom CNN layer** that learns my photo-editing patterns and applies similar transformations autonomously; a fusion of *style transfer* and *personalized learning*.  
- 🚀 At **Stanley Black & Decker**, I automated procurement pipelines and A/B-tested email campaigns, driving **$18M+ in measurable impact**.  
- ⚙️ At **ADP**, I engineered a dynamic thresholding system in Splunk that reduced false alerts by **85%**.
- 📊 Passionate about **experiments, causal inference, building interpretable ML systems**. Advocate for ethical AI use in business and human context.

## 🔬 Current Research Project : *“CineMorph”*  

### 🎯 Goal  
To design a **custom Convolutional Neural Network layer** capable of learning and replicating my personal image-editing style.  
The system aims to **capture transformation intent**, not just color shifts; by modeling latent adjustments from before/after edit pairs.  

### ⚙️ Key Components  
- **Data Generation:** Using personal edited/unedited image pairs as supervised training examples.  
- **Model Architecture:** CNN backbone (ResNet-style) with a **custom delta layer** that learns adjustment residuals.  
- **Loss Functions:** Combination of MSE (pixel difference) and perceptual loss (VGG features).  
- **Training Setup:** PyTorch, fastai, custom dataloader, augmentation pipelines.  
- **Planned Extensions:** Integrating **reinforcement learning** to refine edit confidence, and **LLM-based tagging** for semantic edit context.  

### 🧩 Expected Outcome  
An “auto-edit” model capable of generalizing my editing signature; creating a personalized, generative photo assistant.
