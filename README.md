## GUTEN TAG! 👋
### I am Pradyumn K. Pottapatri! You can call me Sid!

## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** building scalable ML systems, time-series pipelines, and applied AI solutions in **supply chain and analytics** domains.  

- 🧩 Currently exploring **Computer Vision and Generative AI**, developing a **custom CNN layer** that learns my photo-editing patterns and applies similar transformations autonomously; a fusion of *style transfer* and *personalized learning*.  
- 🚀 At **Stanley Black & Decker**, I automated procurement pipelines and A/B-tested email campaigns, driving **$18M+ in measurable impact**.  
- ⚙️ At **ADP**, I engineered a dynamic thresholding system in Splunk that reduced false alerts by **85%**, blending **Kalman Filters** and **Exponential Smoothing** to improve production reliability.  
- 📊 Passionate about **experiments, causal inference, and building interpretable ML systems**. Advocate for ethical AI use in business and human context.  

Experience highlights

- Stanley Black and Decker: automated data pipelines with dbt, Autosys, Python, Snowflake. Led cross functional meetings and negotiated supplier contracts
- ADP: built dynamic thresholding with time series forecasting in Splunk MLTK and reduced false positives by 85 percent
- Georgia State University: graduate research in NLP, Time Series and statistics. Built topic models, time series models and taught R labs
