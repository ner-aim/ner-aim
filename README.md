## GUTEN TAG! ðŸ‘‹
### I am Pradyumn K. Pottapatri!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer who ships. I like turning messy data into reliable systems that move real dollars. I have 4+ years of experience across analytics, ML engineering, and causal evaluation. My happy place is the intersection of Python, SQL, and product impact.

- Built pipelines that cut reporting latency by 90 percent for supplier negotiations.
- Uncovered multimillion dollar opportunities with SQL and Snowflake.
- Delivered dashboards that speed up decisions for supply chain leaders.

What I am building now
- A practical LLM powered search and recommendation stack using RAG, vector search, and summarization.
- Light, fast OCR and vision baselines in PyTorch.

Experience highlights

- Stanley Black and Decker: automated data pipelines with dbt, Autosys, Python, Snowflake. Led cross functional meetings and negotiated supplier contracts
- ADP: built dynamic thresholding with time series forecasting in Splunk MLTK and reduced false positives by 85 percent
- Georgia State University: graduate research in NLP, Time Series and statistics. Built topic models, time series models and taught R labs

Skills and tools

- Languages: Python, C and C++, SQL, R, Spark, MATLAB
- Data and ML: Pandas, scikit learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost
- Platforms: Snowflake, AWS, Docker, dbt, Power BI, Tableau, Splunk MLTK
- Interests: Causal inference, information retrieval, time series, LLM applications
